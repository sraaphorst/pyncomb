**Status:** Complete, verson 1.0.2.

The pyncomb (PYthoN COMBinatorics) library is a collection of functions to work with basic combinatorial objects (e.g. permutations, subsets, tuples), and provides algorithms for ranking, unranking, and iterating over all objects in a specified class.

The most recent release is available from pypi as the "[pyncomb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyncomb)" package, and may be installed via `pip`:

```bash
